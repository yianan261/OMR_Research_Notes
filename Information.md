>  • Replayability: recovering the encoded music itself in terms of pitch, velocity, onset, and duration. This application area sees OMR as a component inside a bigger music processing pipeline that enables the system to operate on music notation documents as just another input. Notice that readability by humans is not required for these applications, as long as the computer can process and “play” the symbolic data. 
>  • Structured Encoding: recovering the music along with the information on how it was encoded using elements of music notation. This avenue is oriented towards providing the score for music
